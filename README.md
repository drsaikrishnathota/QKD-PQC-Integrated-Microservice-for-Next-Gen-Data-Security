# 🧠 Quantum-Enhanced Data Encryption Microservice  
**Java 17 + Spring Boot | Qiskit | Cassandra | Docker**

A production-ready **quantum-inspired data encryption microservice** that integrates **post-quantum cryptography (PQC)** and **quantum key distribution (QKD)** principles for next-generation secure communications.

---

## 🚀 Overview
This project demonstrates a **hybrid encryption system** combining classical and quantum-secure methods.  
It uses:
- **Java 17 (Spring Boot)** for the main microservice  
- **Python (Qiskit)** sidecar simulating BB84 Quantum Key Distribution  
- **Cassandra** for secure, scalable data storage  
- **Docker Compose** for orchestration  

Encrypted data (AES-GCM) is derived from **QKD-generated entropy** and **HKDF-derived AES-256 keys**, ensuring resistance against both classical and quantum attacks.
